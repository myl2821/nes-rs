use crate::Cartridge;

// The NES’ limited memory was sufficient for early games, however as they became more
// complex, games became larger and the memory was insufficient. To allow cartridges to
// contain more ROM, the NES had to be able to swap the data in and out of memory when it
// was needed. Since the NES could not address beyond $FFFF, switching hardware in the
// cartridges themselves was used. This hardware was known as a memory mapper or MMC
// (Memory Management Chip).
//
// The basic idea of memory mapping is that when the system requires access to data on a
// ROM bank that is not currently loaded in memory, the software indicates the need to switch
// banks and the selected bank is loaded into a page in memory, replacing the existing
// contents. The use of memory mappers was one of the factors in the NES’ longevity, allowing
// it to survive technological deficiencies.

// UNROM only allowed switching of PRG-ROM banks. It provided no support for CHR-ROM.
// 16 KB PRG-ROM bank number to load into $8000 directly
// $8000 ~ $BFFF -> First 16 KB of ROM
// $C000 ~ $FFFF -> Last 16 KB of ROM (NROM-256) or mirror of $8000-$BFFF (NROM-128)
